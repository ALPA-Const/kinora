## What is Kinora?

Kinora is a private family communication and connection platform. Unlike public social media, Kinora is exclusively for invited family members who enter a unique license code before registration.

**Pronunciation:** kih-NOR-ah

**Meaning:** "Kin" = family/your people | "Ora" = circle/aura — "The circle of your kin"
